# Snake Game with Machine Learning (ANN)

- Arcade
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

For install these libraries you can run this code in your command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## apple.py
This file makes an apple object for the snake!
## snake.py
This file makes a snake and help to move.
## main_manual.py
In this file you can play the game and enjoy of that without AI!
## main_AI.py
In this file I use a smart algorithm for playing the game!
## generate_dataset.py
1- make a dataset.\
2- saved snake's moving for train.
## train.ipynb
In this data file, it is used to learn the machine and make the model.
## inference
Here you can run the program and see the performance of the snake.
